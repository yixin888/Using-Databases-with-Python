Instructions
If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)
Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, 
and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Leighanna', 36);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Emer', 13);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Josie', 36);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Lilly', 28);
Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:
SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X
Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.
Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, 
the SELECT query above will not work in any other database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.

for row in cur.execute(sqlstr):
    print(str(row[0]), row[1])

cur.close()
